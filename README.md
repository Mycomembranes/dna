# README for Quantum Mechanics and Biological Systems Research Repository

### Overview - PLEASE note that everything here is preliminary and will be updated in the future. You might notice references are missing, and that's because I generated these models using the help of various AI models. The original author's of the models are embedded in the name (i.e., Schrödinger, Hamilton(ian) and others). In this format, all my work are preprints. The novel ideas are all mine tho :). I just don't have the time right now to continue working on this, so I figure I'd release it here on Github for any lucky human that happens to stumble upon my repo :)
